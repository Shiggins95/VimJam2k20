### All artwork, music, sound, code and effects created by me within the 1 week deadline

#### Known Issues

- Can be an issue with colliders when respawning. This was frustrating during the development and settled with disabling players coliders then setting them back to active when he reaches his specified respawn point - not ideal.
- Health Pack message should be disabled after the first time, players don't need to be told every time what the health pack does.
- Too many effects on the final level, can make peoples computers lag and is just too much!
